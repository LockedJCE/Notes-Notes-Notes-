## Description
   This project is an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. 
   This solves the problem of writing your notes in notepad and gives you a place to properly store them! 
   This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. 
   I used render to deploy the website.

## Acceptance-Criteria
   GIVEN a note-taking application
   
   WHEN I open the Note Taker
   
   THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
   
   WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
   
   THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
   
   WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
   
   THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
   
   WHEN I click on the Save button
   
   THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
   
   WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
   
   THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
